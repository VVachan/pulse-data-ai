# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Quick Reference

Your DataGuard project is now ready to push to GitHub! Here's what you need to do:

## 1️⃣ Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **+** → **New repository**
3. Name it `pulse-data-ai` (or your preferred name)
4. Choose **Public** or **Private**
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click **Create repository**

## 2️⃣ Copy the Push Commands

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\ADMIN\OneDrive\Desktop\datagaurd\pulse-data-ai"

# Set the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pulse-data-ai.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3️⃣ Done! Share the Link

Your repository will be at:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pulse-data-ai
```

Share this link with your friend. They can clone it with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pulse-data-ai.git
cd pulse-data-ai
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📋 What's Included in Your Repository

✅ Frontend (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)  
✅ Backend (FastAPI + ML Models)

✅ SETUP.md guide for GitHub  
✅ requirements.txt for Python dependencies  
✅ .gitignore with Node + Python exclusions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Firebase Config**: Your friend needs to create their own Firebase project and add `.env.local` file
- **CSV Files**: Large training datasets are included (make sure GitHub doesn't reject them)
- **ML Models**: `.pkl` files are gitignored, they need to be generated by running `train_model.py`

That's it! You're ready to share your awesome DataGuard project! 🎉
